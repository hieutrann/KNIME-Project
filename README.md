# KNIME Project

We use KNIME - a popular open source data mining tool to predict injury severity using car crash data. The data are made public, and can be found at:

https://www.nhtsa.gov/crash-data-systems/crash-report-sampling-system-crss

We use Accident, Person and Vehicle data to predict the injury severity of drivers and see which predictors are contributed the most for the prediction result. We presented the project in front of OSU MIS department committee, so a ppt file is included.
